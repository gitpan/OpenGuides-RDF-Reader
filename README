NAME
    OpenGuides::RDF::Reader - Parse and return OpenGuides metadata from RDF

SYNOPSIS
      use OpenGuides::RDF::Reader;
      use WWW::Mechanize;
      ...
      my $agent = WWW::Mechanize->new;
      $agent->get("http://fooville.openguides.org/?id=Red_Lion;format=rdf");
      my %metadata = parse_rdf($agent->content);

DESCRIPTION
    The OpenGuides software deliberately exposes data collected on the town
    wiki sites, making it available to other websites as RDF / XML. This
    functionality is provided by the module OpenGuides::RDF supplied in the
    OpenGuides distribution.

    What OpenGuides::RDF::Reader does is the reverse process, i.e. take XML
    RDF data and turn it back into a hash with keys comprising the metadata
    fields in OpenGuides. The main use of this is for guide replication.

  parse_rdf
    This exported subroutine takes a string containing RDF and returns a
    list of metadata key value pairs.
